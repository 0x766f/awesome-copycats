Copycat themes for Awesome WM 3.5
---------
I.E. heavy mods of some stuff I like.

Beware! They're more awesome than they appear, it's just they're shy.

Notable features:
- Autohide widgets (*tell me only when you have to*)
- Autostart functionality
- Fast mpd and volume shortcuts (believe me, nobody showed this before anywhere)
- Other fancy shortcuts for: copying to the clipboard (goodbye clipboard managers!), toggle wiboxes, widgets popups, screenshots, moving clients, user programs
- Dropdown terminal, quake style
- Small but complete calendar, with current day hightlighted and the possibility to switch months back and forward with just a click 
- Very elegant notifications for: new mails, current song, hdd critical state, low battery
- Yahoo Wheather integration 
- A net carrier checker, when you're offline it warns you and lets you start wifi-menu
- Full localization potential (just easy edit about 20 lines)
- Colorful (and nice) icons

They're scattered all over the themes, but you can get them all *only* in Blackburn.

**Blackburn** the wannabe definitive theme
