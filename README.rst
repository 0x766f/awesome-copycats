===== 
Awesome WM Copycats
===== 
A collection of heavy modded themes 
---------

Beware! They're more awesome than they appear, it's just they're shy.

Notable features:

- Autohide widgets (*tell me only when you have to*)
- Autostart functionality
- Fast mpd and volume shortcuts (first time you see this trick on Awesome)
- Other fancy shortcuts for copying to the clipboard (goodbye clipboard managers!), toggle wiboxes, widgets popups, screenshots capture, moving clients
- Quake style dropdown terminal
- Calendar with current day hightlighted plus the possibility to switch months back and forward with just a click 
- Elegant notifications for new mails, current song, hdd critical state, low battery
- Yahoo Wheather integration 
- A net carrier checker, when you're offline it warns you and lets you start wifi-menu
- Full localization potential (just easily edit about 20 lines)
- Colorful autoupdating icons

They're scattered all over the set, but you can get them all *only* in Blackburn.
